# FurFile

## Description

Anyone that has pets knows that they are part of the family. So having their medical records should be important to us. Furfile allows users to track and update their pet’s information online. Just sign in to FurFile and input the information. Each FurFile profile displays the following pet information: 
- Name
- Type (cat or dog)
- Breed
- Birthdate
- Weight
- Gender
- Spayed/Neutered
- Microchip #
- Vaccinations
- Allergies
  
The motivation behind this application was our love for pets and animals. If there ever was an emergency with our pets and our veterinarian’s office was closed, it would be very difficult to access some of this information. Not everyone has their pet’s records on file. Furfile will allow pet owners, veterinarians, and anyone that could need your pet’s information to have access. This could be the difference in saving a pet’s life.

As users, we want an application to keep track of pet data that can be accessed online.
As users, we want to be able to sign in or create a new account.
As registered users, we want a page that can input and edit personal pet information.
